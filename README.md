# emergency_room_notification_service

A code challenge completed for a HealthTech start up specializing in real-time communication technologies for emergency rooms and medium sized medical offices. 

The ask was to create a reusable function that would accent three arguments of type DateTime: 1) current time; 2) earliest completion time; and 3) latest completion time. Based on these, the function would generated a specially formatted string. This would apprise the patient themselves + any of their loved ones of when they'd proceed to the next step of the medical process.

E.g. "The doctor will be in to see you within the next 5-15 minutes."

The code had to also account for certain edge cases and comply with certain formatting rules. Solution was submitted via CoderPad; hence, the main method, the static helper functions, the C# classes, etc. are all part of the same file vs. broken down into standalone classes and folders
